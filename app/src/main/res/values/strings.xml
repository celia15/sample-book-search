    <string name="sophiesReview">Sophie\'s World was a long, strange, and most unpredictable novel.  This was my very first in-depth reading on philosophy.  I read this book over the course of a month, while reading other books in parallel, and sometimes taking a break from it on purpose. Our main character is Sophie Amundsen. A history of philosophy wrapped in great fiction, I was greatly engrossed in Sophie\'s story, thoughts and discoveries, and Jostein Gaarder is an intriguing novelist to boot.
                    Sophie\'s World Philosophy Book
                    The philosophy lessons are chronological and start at the very birth of philosophy with Socrates, Plato and Aristotle. This quick summary on Greek Philosophy can serve as the cliff-notes version of the first few hundred pages of Sophie\'s World. Alberto Knox, the philosophy teacher who makes an appearance in Sophie\'s life before her 15th birthday, takes us through the history of philosophy in scrupulous details. We touch on Socrates, then Plato and then Aristotle, and every other significant contributor to the field of philosophy from pre-Socratic Greeks to Jean Paul-Sartre.  Sophie, meanwhile absorbing this fascinating topic like a new sponge to water, has a present mystery to solve:  She is the confused recipient of numerous postcards from a Major Albert Knag who is stationed in Albania, all of which are intended for his daughter, Hilde Moller Knag.
                    This book is far better than a philosophy textbook and extremely authentic as a novel; the combination makes for an ideal way to learn about philosophy, a topic for which everyone needs a basic introduction.</string>

    <string name="thiefReview">Percy Jackson is just a normal twelve year old boy. Sure he\'s got problems with school, bullies, and authority but at that age who doesn\'t?  Getting kicked out of school after school does have a way of making one think he\'s a screw up though.  One day though on a seemingly innocent visit to the beach with his mother Percy\'s life changes forever.  Finding out his best friends is a satyr and being chased by the Minotaur into a camp for demigods is only the beginning of Percy Jackson\'s new life.  Here he makes friends with children of similar parentage and finally finds himself a place where he belongs.
                        Peace can only last for so long though once it is discovered which god has fathered Percy.  Monstrous attacks begin and Percy is sent on a quest to retrieve Zeus\'s stolen master bolt (the lightening bolt from which all other bolts are made) and return it before the summer solstice to stop an all out war between the gods.  Along the way is more adventure than one boy can handle danger at every turn, and new heights of treachery.
                        An absolutely fantastic tale marvelously woven by the author Rick Riordan.  As a book written for young adults I didn\'t expect it to be as fun and engaging for an actual adult as it was.  Move over Harry Potter because Percy Jackson could kick your butt.  Smart mouthed, practical and fun Percy doesn\'t go looking for trouble but he was born a hero, a combination of mortal and god parentage that he can not control.  In a world where hero\'s are sent on quests all the time and spent their lives training Percy is a rare breath of fresh air.
                        I often fear reading young adult books because the main characters can be whiny and immature (as their audience) which can get on the nerves of any adult.  Amazingly Percy seems to be mostly free of self pity and angst while still staying young and believable.
                        A fantastic book for sure that has me thanking the gods I bought the series. Definitely worth the read!"</string>

    <string name="monsterReview">Thirteen-year-old Percy Jackson\'s strange dreams tell him something\'s wrong at Half-Blood Hill, a summer camp for demigods. He also receives desperate midnight messages from his satyr friend, Grover. Annabeth, a half-human, half-god camper, similar to Percy and Grover, appears at Percy\'s school and confirms his fears. She saves him from a gang of monsters trying to slaughter him on the dodgeball court. Then she delivers him and his hulking new friend, Tyson, to Half-Blood Hill.
                    Percy, Tyson and Annabeth find the camp in chaos. Monsters are attacking, and campers desperately try to defend themselves. When Zeus daughter Thalia turned into a tree six years earlier, her spirit protected the camp from monsters. Now, someone has poisoned Thalia\'s tree. Percy\'s mentor, a centaur named Chiron, has been blamed and fired from Half-Blood Hill. A spirit from the fields of punishment named Tantalus has assumed Chiron\'s position as assistant camp director.
                    Annabeth reveals that Tyson is a Cyclops, and Poseidon himself claims Tyson as his son (and Percy\'s half-brother). Percy and Annabeth ask the camp leaders for permission to seek the Golden Fleece, which they believe will heal Thalia\'s tree. The leaders give the quest to another camper, a belligerent daughter of Ares named Clarisse. Urged on by Hermes, the messenger god, Percy, decides to find the Fleece himself. Annabeth and Tyson join him on this unauthorized journey.
                    The trio lands on a cruise ship, only to find Luke, a former camper and Percy\'s nemesis from the first book in this series, The Lightning Thief, is its captain. He is recruiting half-bloods to help him start a new civilization with Kronos at the helm. Kronos, the Titan king and enemy to the gods, was previously cut into pieces but re-forms a little each time a half-blood joins Luke\'s army.
                    After escaping from Luke and subsequently battling a multi-headed monster, Percy, Annabeth and Tyson are saved by Clarisse. They all sail on her ghost ship full of dead Confederate soldiers toward the Sea of Monsters (i.e., the Bermuda Triangle) in search of Grover and the Fleece. As they enter the Sea, monsters attack the ship. Percy and Annabeth, thinking they\'re the sole survivors, sail into the lair of Circe, where Percy is temporarily transformed into a rodent by the man-hating sorceress. They escape once more and sail toward the island of the Sirens. Annabeth desperately wants to hear them. She asks Percy to tie her to something so she can listen but not be lured by their songs. Percy plugs his own ears with wax. Annabeth is so mesmerized that she cuts her way out of her ropes and swims to the island. Percy narrowly saves her.
                    Percy and Annabeth reach the island of the Cyclops Polyphemus, where they find both Grover and the Fleece. They also discover that Clarisse and Tyson are alive. The heroes battle and trick the Cyclops, escaping with the Fleece. In keeping with the prophesy Clarisse received from the Oracle, the group sends her back to camp via airplane with the Fleece. Luke recaptures Percy, Annabeth, Grover and Tyson. Then Percy sends a message telling the Half-Blood campers that Luke poisoned Thalia\'s tree. Chiron and his relatives save Percy and friends, returning them to camp where Chiron\'s name is cleared and he is reinstated. The Fleece heals Thalia\'s tree, and Thalia herself emerges from the tree as the half-blood she once was.</string>
